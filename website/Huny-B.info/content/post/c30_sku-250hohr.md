## Information Panels

**Intended Use**

We have designed our signature Hemp Oil Heat Rub 
to penetrate sore muscles and joints by using and aging CBD, 
derived from the Hemp Plant, Hemp Seed Oil, Arnica, 
and 20 Essential Oils and Herbs in a certain blend to get the job done!

**Direction for Safe Use**

Apply a generous amount of our Hemp Oil Heat Rub 
on your sore muscles and joints. 
Rub and massage the sore area 
to get the full affect of the product. 
For extra heat and greater results massage 
in your sore muscles and joints after bathing 
while your pores are still open but your skin is not too hot. 

**Caution**

Wash your hands after applying. 
Do not take by mouth. 
Topical liniment is for use only on the skin. 
Do not use liniment on open wounds or on sunburned, 
windburned, dry, chapped, or irritated skin. 
If this liniment gets in your eyes, nose, mouth, rectum, or vagina, 
rinse with water. 
Cayenne contains capsaicin. 
It is not known whether capsaicin topical passes into breast milk 
or if it could harm a nursing baby. 
Do not apply liniment to your breast area 
if you are breast-feeding a baby.
