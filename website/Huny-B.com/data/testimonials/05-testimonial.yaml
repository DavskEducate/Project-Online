  Thank you for introducing me to your heral health
  and bath products, especially the Hemp Oil Rub.
  It has been ONLY a little over a month since I first 
  "tentatly" used the Rub. It has now become my "go to" 
  product, even to the point of replacing my use of
  LYRICA. (I hated the side effects that it had) I
  have nueropahty in my right foot, the chronic drop 
  foot, the scarring and tissue damage, the loss of 
  1/3 of my calf muscle mass. I was not nor  will I 
  ever be free of pain.  Now, add in the arthritis 
  changes that come with being 70 and you can imagine,
  I have not enjoyed life much the past 8 years.
  Your Rub has really made a difference. It seems to 
  "calm" the nerves, quieting down the sharpenss and 
  stinging and softens the skin and relaxes the muscles.
  I am now using it faithfully 2 times a day. Morning
  and night.
  I strongly recommed this product!!
