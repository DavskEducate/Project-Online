  I wanted to give an update!! I have recently
  started using the Rub on my left foot. I 
  have an extreme bunion on my big toe causing
  a "frozen hammer toe" of my second toe, that
  is very painful. One evening I rubbed your
  rub on both toes and within 15 minutes I 
  was amazed at what happened. The rub relaxed
  the 2 toes enough that I could move them 
  slightly independent of each other. It has 
  been years since I have been able to do that!!
  My use of the Rub has expanded. For me, it also 
  works for tired overworkded muscles, arthritic
  aches and pains. I can feel the penetrating
  and soothing qualities, heat then cooling
  without a strong medicinal smell. 
  On a side note about the smell, it soothes the 
  nasual and sinues. lol
  Thank you, you have made a believer out of me,
  you have discovered a wonderful blend that 
  works great for me!
