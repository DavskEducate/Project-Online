For those who prefer mild stimulation and heat we have created the Huny-B CBD salve. As you can see the ingredients ranging from the obvious CBD and Hemp Seed Oil; to soothing  Arnica.  Chamomile and Eucalyptus provides a stark contrast with the Essential Oils such as Black Pepper oil, Cinnamon oil,  Camphor oil , and Menthol Crystals . Of course there are many more essential oils and ingredients besides these, but the point is that this creates a unique feeling that is just as welcome on sore muscles, aches and pains as it is on healthy skin.
